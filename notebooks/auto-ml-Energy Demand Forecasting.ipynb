    "\n",
    ">* Select the Kernet Python 3.6\n",
    ">* Jupyter has 'cells'. When you click on anywhere in the notebook, the cell containing the pointer gets selected.\n",
    ">* To run or execute the code in the cell - on the top menu select Cell->Run Cells. Alternatively you can use 'Shift+Enter' keys.\n",
    ">* To Edit cell - Double click the cell\n",
    ">* When you run a cell, the pointer pointing just outside on the left side of the cell will change from [] to [*] (inserts * in the square brackets). When the cell finished executing the '*' changes to a number.\n",
    ">* If the notebook or cell hangs, select from the top menu Kernel->Restart & Clear output for the entire notebook or Kernel->Interrupt for just that cell. Restart will take a few seconds and you would need to reexecute all the cells.\n",
    ">* In Jupyter you do not need to execute in sequence. You can go back to a previous cell that was already executed and execute again. As long as there are no dependencies that messes up the code in that particular cell, you will be fine."

    "# Automated Machine Learning: Energy Demand Forecasting\n",

    "## Use case overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario focuses on energy demand forecasting where the goal is to predict the future load on an energy grid. It is a critical business operation for companies in the energy sector as operators need to maintain the fine balance between the energy consumed on a grid and the energy supplied to it. Too much power supplied to the grid can result in waste of energy or technical faults. However, if too little power is supplied it can lead to blackouts, leaving customers without power. Typically, grid operators can take short-term decisions to manage energy supply to the grid and keep the load in balance. An accurate short-term forecast of energy demand is therefore essential for the operator to make these decisions with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario details the construction of a machine learning energy demand forecasting solution. The solution is trained on a public dataset from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), which operates the power grid for New York State. The dataset includes hourly power demand data for New York City over a period of five years. An additional dataset containing hourly weather conditions in New York City over the same time period was taken from darksky.net.\n",
